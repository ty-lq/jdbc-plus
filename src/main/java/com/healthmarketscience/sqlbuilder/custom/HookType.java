 * inserted if the anchor clause itself is included.  Note that if any {@code
 * REPLACEMENT} type is used, the anchor text itself will <i>not</i> be
 * inserted.
 * <p>
 * The {@code BEFORE} and {@code AFTER} types, while similar in location to
 * the {@code PREFIX} and {@code SUFFIX} types (respectively), are included
 * regardless of whether or not the anchor clause itself is included (they are
 * more related to the surrounding clause than the anchor clause itself).
 * <p>
 * Note that customizable queries support multiple instances of each type for
 * a given anchor.  Multiple customizations of the same type will be inserted
 * in the order they were added to the query.
