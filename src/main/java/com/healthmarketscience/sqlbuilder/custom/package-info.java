/**
 * SqlBuilder supports two types of custom SQL:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Custom values/expressions within existing queries - this type of
 *     customization can be achieved using the custom SqlObject variants:
 *     {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.CustomSql}, {@link
 *     com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.CustomExpression}, and {@link
 *     com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.CustomCondition}.</li>
 * <li>Custom clauses added to existing queries - the classes in this package
 *     (and subpackages) enable this type of customization, read on for
 *     details.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Custom SQL Syntax</h2>
 * <p>
 * Inserting custom SQL syntax into queries involves a few different pieces
 * all working together.
 * <ul>
 * <li>A query (or other existing SqlObject type) which has enabled custom SQL
 *     syntax support (e.g. {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.SelectQuery}).  This is done via a
 *     nested {@code Hook} enum which defines the "hook anchors" for that type
 *     (e.g. {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.SelectQuery.Hook}).</li>
 * <li>A "hook anchor" (an enum which implements the {@link
 *     com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.custom.HookAnchor} marker interface)
 *     defines locations within the related query in which custom SQL syntax
 *     can be inserted.  Custom SQL syntax generally falls into one of two
 *     categories: additional keywords which enhance an existing clause or
 *     additional sub-clauses within a query.  In both cases, the custom
 *     syntax needs to be inserted into the correct location within the query
 *     and the "hook anchor" provides the first of two important bits of
 *     location information.</li>
 * <li>The {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.custom.HookType} is the
 *     second bit of important information which ties the custom SQL syntax to
 *     the correct location in the query.  It defines how the custom syntax
 *     should be inserted relative to the "hook anchor".</li>
 * <li>The actual custom SQL syntax object.  For convenience, the custom
 *     syntax implementation may extend {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.custom.CustomSyntax}, but that is
 *     not a requirement.  {@code CustomSyntax} based implementations know how
 *     to insert themselves into the correct location in relevant queries so

 *     they can easily be added to a query using the simplified {@code
 *     addCustomization()} method (e.g. {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.SelectQuery#addCustomization(CustomSyntax)}).
 *     However, any ad hoc custom syntax can be added to customizable queries
 *     by specifying the HookType and "hook anchor" when adding (e.g. {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.SelectQuery#addCustomization(Hook,HookType,Object)})</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Supported Customizations</h3>
 * <p>
 * SqlBuilder currently has existing constructs for few common database
 * specific customizations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Oracle {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.custom.oracle}</li>
 * <li>MySQL {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.custom.mysql}</li>
 * <li>PostreSQL {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.custom.postgresql}</li>
 * <li>SQL Server {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.custom.sqlserver}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Customizable Queries</h3>
 * <p>
 * Only a few SqlBuilder queryies are currently customizable:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.SelectQuery}</li>
 * <li>{@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.CreateTableQuery}</li>
 * <li>{@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.CreateIndexQuery}</li>
 * </ul>
