<p>
Very basic implementations of the
{@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.dbspec dbspec} interfaces.  The
basically just aggregate the configuration information into useful objects,
but provide no internal consistency checking.  These should be used for simple
and/or non-production code.  For more complicated and/or robust production
scenarios, implementations with stricter constraints and internal consistency
verification should be used.
