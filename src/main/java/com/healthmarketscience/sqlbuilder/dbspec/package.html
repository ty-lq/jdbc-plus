<p>
Group of interfaces which simplify the usage of SqlBuilder when multiple
queries will be built over the same collection of database objects.  Instead
of having a large list of String constants which are continually referenced
throughout the query generation code, instances of objects implementing these
interfaces can be configured once and easily reused in subsequent queries
since many of the SqlBuilder objects have simplified usage when working with
these objects.

<p>
The {@link com.healthmarketscience.sqlbuilder.dbspec.basic dbspec.basic}
package has some very simple implementations of these interfaces.
